# RElative STrength Of Relative Eigenvectors (RESTORE)
# ##############################################################################
# Estimates shape variance captured by each relative eigenvector and all 
# relative eigenvectors combined.

# Argument
# @lmGpA A matrix of N_1 * (p * k), where N_1 is the number of observations in
# group A. p is the number of landmarks and K is the dimension, which is 2 or 3.
# @lmGpB A matrix of N_2 * (p * k), where N_2 is the number of observations in
# group B. p is the number of landmarks and K is the dimension, which is 2 or 3.
# @relEigenObjAB Results from relative.eigen(S1, S2), where S1 is covariance
# matrix for group A and S2 is covariance matrix for group B. Usually scores
# along the first M PCs are used as shape variables in each group.

# Output
# \item{EigVal} Shape varaince explained by each of the first M PCs.
# \item{RESTORE_All} RESTORE_All suggests it contains output from
# the RESTORE function for results obtained by combining all relative
# eigenvectors. It is a list of two components. The first component RESTORE1 
# gives the ratio of shape variance along the first M PCs 
# captured by all relative eigenvectors to shape variance. This is the 
# proportion of shape variance captured by all relative eigenvectors, when 
# relative PCA is performed using the first M PCs of shape. Since relative PCA
# is performed only using M PCs, the proportion of shape variance along the 
# first M PCs captured by all relative eigenvectors is also provided, which is
# stored in RESTORE2. Small RESTORE1 suggests that relative eigenvectors capture 
# a small proportion of shape variance. But it may be possible that this results 
# from the limited shape variance captured by the first M PCs. If RESTORE2 is 
# also small, this would suggest the small variance captured by relative 
# eigenvectors is not due to limited shape variance as input for the relative 
# PCA, but rather is indeed due to the fact that the directions along which 
# variance varies between group A and B capture only a small proportion of shape 
# variance.
# \item{RESTORE_AExcessVar} RESTORE_AExcessVar suggests it contains output from
# the RESTORE function for results on the analysis of the part of the relative
# eigenvectors with relative eigenvalues greater than 1. This is equivalent to 
# the relative eigenvectors where group A has excess variance relative to group
# B. This can be claimed in that S1 and S2 are entered in the the function
# relative.eigen in the order of relative.eigen(S1, S2). RESTORE_each is a 
# numeric vector with length equal to the number of relative eigenvalues greater
# than 1. Each of its component is the shape variance along the first M PCs 
# captured by each relative eigenvector. RESTORE_lambdaIdx contains the index of 
# ùúÜ value closest to each element of RESTORE_each. p_RESTORE_each is the ratio 
# of shape variance along the first M PCs captured by each relative eigenvector 
# to shape variance. This is the proportion of shape variance captured by each
# relative eigenvector.
# \item{RESTORE_BExcessVar} RESTORE_BExcessVar suggests it contains output from
# the RESTORE function for results on the analysis of the part of the relative
# eigenvectors with relative eigenvalues smaller than 1. This is equivalent to 
# the relative eigenvectors where group B has excess variance relative to group
# A. This can be claimed in that S1 and S2 are entered in the the function
# relative.eigen in the order of relative.eigen(S1, S2). RESTORE_each is a 
# numeric vector with length equal to the number of relative eigenvalues smaller
# than 1. Each of its component is the shape variance along the first M PCs 
# captured by each relative eigenvector. RESTORE_lambdaIdx contains the index of 
# ùúÜ value closest to each element of RESTORE_each. p_RESTORE_each is the ratio 
# of shape variance along the first M PCs captured by each relative eigenvector 
# to shape variance. This is the proportion of shape variance captured by each
# relative eigenvector.
